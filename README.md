# Spotify Song Selector
### Ben Polson, with some help from Akshay Yadava
The goal of this project is to generate a catered song playlist based on a user's preferences using data from the Spotify API. All other information is detailed in the Final Report. This project is ongoing and the Final Report is up to date on current progress. There are three annotated Jupyter Notebook files containing all of the code.
