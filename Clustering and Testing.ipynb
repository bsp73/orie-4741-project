    "Since it is difficult to spot the elbow in the sum of squared distances to centroids, we also plotted the percent decrease in sum of squared distances to centroids from one value of k to the next. From those points, it is more obvious that it is around k = 80. To further narrow down k, we will use the silhouette method from k = 75 to k = 85. Since we are allowing the user to say they don't care about particular features, need to automate this process. Therefore, we will choose the first k value (to the nearest 10) where the percent decrease is 5% or below."
